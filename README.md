# Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot

This project (surely you can tell) is currently under development just barely in it's infancy. The scope of this project will cover a broad spectrum of topics including NLP (for sentiment mining from news), web scraping (to collect prices), database management (storage of prices) - SQL/noSQL, object-oriented-programming with modularization and packaging, reinforcement learning frameworks (gym) and of course data manipulation with pandas, numpy & tensorflow.

This project will also implement a variety of techniques to reduce runtime/overhead via optimization as it will be running in GCP. A few examples of such are asynchronous processing via threading/multiprocessing/asyncio, ensuring vectorization of operations and if time permits, an overhaul using faster libraries like polars instead of pandas.
